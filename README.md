Setup the extension:

* Browse to [WorkFlowy](https://workflowy.com) in a browser tab and ensure you are logged in.

* In the popup, click "Resynchronize with WorkFlowy".

* Zoom into the list that you want to designate as your inbox. Then in the popup, press "Make current list your inbox".

Clip to WorkFlowy:

* When visiting a page that you want to save, or whenever you have an idea that you'd like to jot down, just press the WorkFlowy toolbar icon.
