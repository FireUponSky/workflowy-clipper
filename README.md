## What is it?

[WorkFlowy](https://workflowy.com) is a minimalist outlining & note-taking application. This Chrome extension allows you to designate a WorkFlowy sublist as your "inbox" and quickly save notes to it.

## How to use it

Install the Chrome extension:

* Go to [chrome://extensions](chrome://extensions).

* Use your file manager to drag & drop workflowy-clipper.crx into your Chrome window.

Setup the extension:

* Browse to [WorkFlowy](https://workflowy.com) in a browser tab and ensure you are logged in.

* Click the new toolbar icon.

* In the popup, click "Resynchronize with WorkFlowy".

* Zoom into the list that you want to designate as your inbox. Then in the popup, press "Make current list your inbox".

Clip something:

* When visiting a page that you want to save, or whenever you have an idea that you'd like to jot down, just press the WorkFlowy toolbar icon.

## Isn't there already an extension for this?

There is "[Clip to WorkFlowy](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/clip-to-workflowy/cfifjihfoegnccifkcdomdookdckhaah)", but what it does is just copy the current window title + location to the clipboard. Then you go to WorkFlowy yourself and paste it. In contrast, this extension actually adds it an item WorkFlowy for you.

## To-do:

* Actively 'push_and_poll' WorkFlowy to detect online/logged-in status.
